Hidden Cipher Text Policy Attribute-Based Encryption with Fast Decryption for Personal Health Record Systems

Introduction
This repository provides an implementation of a Hidden Cipher Text Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) scheme with fast decryption, specifically designed for Personal Health Record (PHR) systems. Our scheme ensures secure and efficient sharing of PHR data, while maintaining fine-grained access control and protecting patient privacy.

Features
- Hidden Cipher Text Policy ABE: Our scheme hides the access policy in the cipher text, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the encrypted data.
- Fast Decryption: Our scheme achieves fast decryption, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices and large-scale PHR systems.
- Fine-Grained Access Control: Our scheme enables fine-grained access control, allowing data owners to specify complex access policies based on attributes.
- Secure Data Sharing: Our scheme ensures secure data sharing, protecting PHR data from unauthorized access and tampering.
